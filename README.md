# passwordGenerator
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a password generator using uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters.

To do this firs we set const to the given name of the values that are contained within the string.

Next prompt the user with a series of prompts to determine what values they want to have included in their password, check to see that they said ok to atleast one criteria, and then determine how many characters they want their password to be.

In the next step we take the string of values and combine them to create a string of all the possible values of the password4

We then generate a pw using that string of all the values and input that into the HTML
